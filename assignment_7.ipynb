    "Data abstraction can be achieved in Python through the use of classes and objects. Here are the steps to achieve data abstraction:\n",

    "Define a Class: Create a class that represents the abstract data type or entity you want to abstract. The class should encapsulate the relevant data and behaviors.\n",

    "Hide Implementation Details: Hide the internal implementation details of the class by using access modifiers. In Python, there are no strict access modifiers like in some other programming languages, but you can use naming conventions to indicate the intended visibility of attributes and methods. Prefixing an attribute or method with a single underscore (_) indicates that it is intended for internal use within the class, while prefixing with two underscores (__) performs name mangling, making the attribute or method more difficult to access from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide a Public Interface: Define public methods or properties that allow users of the class to interact with the underlying data and perform desired operations. These methods serve as an interface to the internal implementation and provide a simplified way to work with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulate Data: Encapsulate the data within the class by defining attributes and accessing them through getter and setter methods. This helps in controlling access to the data and enforcing any necessary validation or business logic.\n",
